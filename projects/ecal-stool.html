        <h2>Project Concept</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, we were asked to design a stool in teams of two. I proposed creating a stool that could be <strong>assembled without any tools</strong>. I found a partner that had experience in wood manufacturing and laser cutting. In one day we had the main concept and few weeks later the refined and finalized object.

        <h2>Design & Drafting</h2>
        <p>
            After brainstorming several concepts, we finalized a <strong>three-legged stool</strong> design. I drafted the pieces and modeled the stool in <strong>CATIA</strong>, ensuring it could be assembled easily and remain stable.

        <h2>Manufacturing & Finishing</h2>
        <p>
            The stool was manufactured using laser cutting and woodworking techniques. After assembly, we applied paint as a final touch to enhance the finish and aesthetics.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The project was a success, and we received a <strong>6/6 grade</strong> at ECAL for our design, execution, and innovation.
        </p><p>
            Fun fact - we became friends and give each other the stool each year to make sure we stay in touch!
